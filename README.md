leaflet sprites
=====
use css style sprites, available colors are blue (default), green, orange, yellow, purple, and violet, create using L.spriteIcon("color"?), [leaflet.css](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/leaflet.css) is required to use it, also [this script for client side CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/extras/coffee-script.js) because I havn't gotten around to building it yet. Also has retina icons.

current issues, best way to refer to the images
